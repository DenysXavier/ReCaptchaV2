# ReCaptchaV2

**ReCaptchaV2** is a PHP implementation of Google ReCaptcha API version 2. It is intended to wrap the new Google ReCaptcha API into a simple class that provides ways to get the "No Captcha Widget" and easily validate the browser response.

## What is a Captcha?

A *CAPTCHA* (an acronym for "**C**ompletely **A**utomated **P**ublic **T**uring test to tell **C**omputers and **H**umans **A**part") is a type of challenge-response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human.

## What is ReCaptcha?

*ReCaptcha* is a user-dialogue system originally developed by Luis von Ahn, Ben Maurer, Colin McMillen, David Abraham and Manuel Blum at Carnegie Mellon University's main Pittsburgh campus, and acquired by Google in September 2009. Like the CAPTCHA interface, ReCaptcha asks users to enter words seen in distorted text images onscreen.

In 2013, ReCaptcha began implementing behavioral analysis of the browser's interactions with the CAPTCHA to predict whether the user was a human or a bot before displaying the captcha, and presenting a "considerably more difficult" captcha in cases where it had reason to think the user might be a bot.

Google states that ReCaptcha is a free service to protect websites from spam and abuse, keeping automated software from engaging in abusive activities. It does this while letting valid users pass through with ease. Every time Google CAPTCHAs are solved, that human effort helps digitize text, annotate images, and build machine learning datasets. This in turn helps preserve books, improve maps, and solve hard AI problems.
